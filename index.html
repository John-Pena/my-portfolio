                    <div>

                        <p>
                            I'm currently engaged and plan to get married next year in May. I enjoy learning new things and get an rush when I'm able to solve a problem.
                        </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            I currently have a job as an arcade tech at Andretti Indoor Karting and Games. I enjoy this job as everyday something new arises and I have to use
                            all resources available to me in order to solve/fix an issue that arises. It was with this job that I found a passion for creating and fixing things.
                            This job is what led me to pursue a career in software development.
                        </p>
                            <br>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy learning about the unknown. This could be the universe, new technologies, and what the breaking news is of the racing world. I currently keep up
                            Formula 1 as they just introduced new regulations that could create new opportunities for the back marker teams to be contenders and vice versa. 
                        </p>
